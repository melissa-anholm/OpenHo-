# Open-source Spaceward Ho! Re-implemention

This is a project to re-implement the classic game Spaceward Ho! as a native Mac program.  It is expected to be compatible with Mac OS 10.14 (Mojave) and later.  

The original game is here, and it was glorious:  https://www.deltatao.com/ho/pc.html 
This attempt at re-implementation is inspired by, and to some extent based on, a similar project here:  https://github.com/Mr-Twave/Open_Spaceward_Ho- At the time of this writing, that project is still incomplete and possibly abandoned, but this current project is slightly different in scope and implementation.  

As I lack both the level of software development expertise and the patience needed to tackle a project like this on my own, I've decided to see what I can get by enlisting AI to help.  To that end, I've made extensive use of the Manus AI (https://manus.im/).  

### Moar:
Over the years I have gotten a lot of entertainment out of Spaceward Ho! as well as other games created by Delta Tao.  Sadly, Spaceward Ho! seems to have been largely abandoned, and the parent company Delta Tao may or may not be defunct.  The last official version of Spaceward Ho! cannot be played on modern operating systems, and I have heard reports that their registration server is perpetually down as well, so even legitimately purchased copies of Spaceward Ho! from years ago operating on very old systems are now perpetually stuck in demo mode if they ever need to be re-installed.
