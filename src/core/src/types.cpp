// This file contains implementations of type-related functions.
// Currently, the types are simple data structures without complex initialization.
// This file serves as a placeholder for future type-related utility functions.

// Future additions might include:
// - Validation functions for data structures
// - Conversion functions between types
// - Factory functions for creating game entities
