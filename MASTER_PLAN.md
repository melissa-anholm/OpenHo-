# OpenHo Master Plan

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026  
**Project Status:** Phase 2 - C++ Core Implementation (In Progress)

---

## Executive Summary

OpenHo is a re-implementation of the classic game "Spaceward Ho!" as a native macOS application. The project is being developed in three phases:

1. **Phase 2 (Current):** C++ game engine with deterministic gameplay and C API interface
2. **Phase 3a:** Objective-C++ bridging layer for macOS integration
3. **Phase 3b:** Native SwiftUI user interface for macOS

The project uses a command-line build system (no Xcode dependency) with CMake for C++ components and Swift Package Manager for the final application.

---

## Project Vision

**Goal:** Create a fully functional, native macOS version of Spaceward Ho! that:
- Runs natively on macOS 10.14 (Mojave) and later
- Maintains deterministic gameplay for multiplayer synchronization
- Uses modern Swift/SwiftUI for the user interface
- Provides a clean C++ core engine with well-defined API boundaries

**Inspiration:** Based on the original Delta Tao game and informed by the Mr-Twave Open_Spaceward_Ho- project.

```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes/Structs:** PascalCase (e.g., `GameState`, `ColonizedPlanet`)
- **Functions/Methods:** snake_case (e.g., `process_turn()`, `calculate_income()`)
- **Variables/Members:** snake_case (e.g., `current_turn`, `player_money`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual RNG Engines:**
   - `deterministicRNG`: Shared game mechanics (reproducible across all players)
   - `aiRNG`: AI decisions (seeded each turn by host, allows variation)

2. **Nested MoneyAllocation:**
   - `MoneyAllocation` struct nested within `Player` class
   - Contains global allocations (research, savings) and per-planet allocations (terraforming, mining)

3. **ColonizedPlanet Architecture (Refactored):**
   - No longer inherits from Planet (pointer-based composition)
   - Holds `Planet*` pointer to base planet (not owned)
   - Holds `Player*` pointer to owner player
   - Adds player-specific data: `population`, `income`, `allocation`
   - Calculates `apparent_gravity` and `apparent_temperature` based on player ideals
   - Owned directly by `Player::colonized_planets` vector

4. **Consolidated Planet Processing:**
   - Single `process_planets()` method handles terraforming and mining
   - Operates on `player.colonized_planets` vector

5. **C API Interface:**
   - All functions use `void*` for opaque game state pointer
   - Enables Objective-C++ bridging without exposing C++ types to Swift
   - Clean separation between core engine and UI layers

6. **Planet Identification:**
   - Planet name is the primary identifier (used for lookups)
   - Planet ID is assigned by GameState but secondary to name
   - Both are required and assigned together at planet creation

7. **Sentinel Values:**
   - `UNKNOWN_DOUBLE_VALUE = -500.0` for unknown double fields
   - `UNKNOWN_INT_VALUE = -500` for unknown int32_t fields
   - `INCOME_UNKNOWN = INT32_MIN` for unknown income
   - `NOT_OWNED = 0` for unowned planets
   - `OWNER_UNKNOWN = UINT32_MAX` for unknown owner
   - Player IDs must never be 0 (reserved for NOT_OWNED)

8. **PlanetSnapshot:**
   - Represents a player's knowledge of a planet at a specific observation time
   - Two factory methods: `partial_info()` and `full_info()`
   - Tracks which player created the snapshot (`as_seen_by`)
   - Stores apparent values (temperature, gravity) based on observer's ideals

- ✅ Added accessor methods: get_planet_name_list(), get_player_name_list(Gender)
- ✅ Created TextAssets directory with 5 JSON files (planets, players, ships, techs, radical)
- ✅ Cleaned up text asset parsing (removed artifacts, split merged entries)

**Architecture Improvements:**
- GameSetup handles user interaction and parameter collection
- GameState owns setup data for lifetime of game
- Better encapsulation: setup concerns separated from game logic

### Phase 4: Sophisticated AI Development (Future)

**Status:** Planning/Design phase

**Purpose:** Develop a powerful, self-improving AI opponent through a multi-layered approach combining spatial analysis, behavioral cloning, and generative adversarial networks.

**Architecture Overview:**

1. **Influence Maps (Spatial Analysis)**
   - Analyze galaxy topology and player positions
   - Calculate strategic zones, threats, opportunities
   - Provides interpretable spatial reasoning

2. **Expert Behavior Cloning**
   - Record expert human gameplay
   - Train neural network to recognize expert decision patterns
   - Provides "expert taste" to discriminator
   - Data sources: player recordings, synthetic expert data from heuristics

3. **GAN Training (Self-Play Improvement)**
   - **Generator:** Creates novel strategies and move sequences
   - **Discriminator:** Initialized with expert behavior model, evaluates move quality
   - **Training:** Self-play games between generator and discriminator
   - Result: AI learns to generate expert-like but novel strategies
   - No explicit reward function needed (discriminator provides feedback)

4. **Difficulty Levels**
   - Different training iterations = different skill levels
   - Different discriminator weights = different personalities
   - Seeded randomness for variety (not fully deterministic)

**Development Phases:**

**Phase 4a: Influence Maps & Strategic Framework**
- [ ] Implement spatial analysis system
- [ ] Define influence map calculations
- [ ] Create heuristic decision-making framework
- [ ] Baseline AI using influence maps and heuristics

**Phase 4b: Behavioral Cloning**
- [ ] Design expert data collection system
- [ ] Record expert games (player recordings)
- [ ] Extract features from game states
- [ ] Train neural network on expert decisions
- [ ] Validate cloning model accuracy

**Phase 4c: GAN Training Infrastructure**
- [ ] Design generator network architecture
- [ ] Integrate discriminator with cloning model
- [ ] Implement self-play training loop
- [ ] Create training harness for offline training
- [ ] Train multiple AI agents with different parameters

**Phase 4d: Difficulty & Personality**
- [ ] Create difficulty level progression
- [ ] Design personality profiles (if desired)
- [ ] Tune discriminator weights for variety
- [ ] Validate AI quality at each difficulty level

**Key Design Decisions:**
- AI is non-deterministic (seeded randomness for variety)
- Training happens offline before release
- Runtime AI is fast (just evaluates learned patterns)
- Training can be computationally expensive
- Self-play eliminates need for explicit reward function

**Dependencies:**
- Complete Phase 2 game mechanics
- Stable game state serialization
- RandomAI framework from Phase 2b (reusable infrastructure)
- Expert gameplay data

**Estimated Effort:** Very High (significant ML/AI work)

**Deliverable:** Trained AI models for multiple difficulty levels

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Deferred Features
- **Save/Load Game State:** Requirement documented, implementation deferred to Phase 2
  - Format: Binary preferred, JSON as alternative
  - No database unless absolutely necessary
  - Must support mid-game persistence for human players

- **Battle Mechanics:** Phase 2e feature, deferred until core systems stable
  - Combat resolution when fleets meet
  - Damage calculation and ship destruction
  - Victory conditions and surrender
  - Placeholder implementation needed for turn processing
  - Full implementation after Phase 2 core is complete

- **Sophisticated AI:** Phase 4 feature, deferred until Phase 2 game mechanics are complete
  - Uses influence maps, behavioral cloning, and GAN training
  - Requires expert gameplay data for behavioral cloning
  - Training happens offline before release
  - Runtime AI is fast and non-deterministic

### Design Notes
- Player IDs must never be 0 (reserved for NOT_OWNED sentinel)
- Planet names must be unique (used as primary identifier)
- ColonizedPlanet uses pointer-based composition to avoid data duplication
- Phase 2b RandomAI provides infrastructure for Phase 4 sophisticated AI
- GAN training uses discriminator initialized with expert behavior model
- Galaxy initialization must happen before any gameplay
- Ship movement is prerequisite for combat and exploration
- Battle mechanics can be stubbed initially, fully implemented later
