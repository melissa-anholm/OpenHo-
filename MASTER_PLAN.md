# OpenHo Master Plan

**Last Updated:** January 1, 2026 (Session 2)  
**Project Status:** Phase 2 - C++ Core Implementation (In Progress)

---

## Executive Summary

OpenHo is a re-implementation of the classic game "Spaceward Ho!" as a native macOS application. The project is being developed in three phases:

1. **Phase 2 (Current):** C++ game engine with deterministic gameplay and C API interface
2. **Phase 3a:** Objective-C++ bridging layer for macOS integration
3. **Phase 3b:** Native SwiftUI user interface for macOS

The project uses a command-line build system (no Xcode dependency) with CMake for C++ components and Swift Package Manager for the final application.

---

## Project Vision

**Goal:** Create a fully functional, native macOS version of Spaceward Ho! that:
- Runs natively on macOS 10.14 (Mojave) and later
- Maintains deterministic gameplay for multiplayer synchronization
- Uses modern Swift/SwiftUI for the user interface
- Provides a clean C++ core engine with well-defined API boundaries

**Inspiration:** Based on the original Delta Tao game and informed by the Mr-Twave Open_Spaceward_Ho- project.

```

### Naming Conventions

- **Classes/Structs:** PascalCase (e.g., `GameState`, `ColonizedPlanet`)
- **Functions/Methods:** snake_case (e.g., `process_turn()`, `calculate_income()`)
- **Variables/Members:** snake_case (e.g., `current_turn`, `player_money`)
- **Constants:** UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Dual RNG Engines:**
   - `deterministicRNG`: Shared game mechanics (reproducible across all players)
   - `aiRNG`: AI decisions (seeded each turn by host, allows variation)

2. **Nested MoneyAllocation:**
   - `MoneyAllocation` struct nested within `Player` class
   - Contains global allocations (research, savings) and per-planet allocations (terraforming, mining)

3. **ColonizedPlanet Architecture (Refactored):**
   - No longer inherits from Planet (pointer-based composition)
   - Holds `Planet*` pointer to base planet (not owned)
   - Holds `Player*` pointer to owner player
   - Adds player-specific data: `population`, `income`, `allocation`
   - Calculates `apparent_gravity` and `apparent_temperature` based on player ideals
   - Owned directly by `Player::colonized_planets` vector

4. **Consolidated Planet Processing:**
   - Single `process_planets()` method handles terraforming and mining
   - Operates on `player.colonized_planets` vector

5. **C API Interface:**
   - All functions use `void*` for opaque game state pointer
   - Enables Objective-C++ bridging without exposing C++ types to Swift
   - Clean separation between core engine and UI layers

6. **Planet Identification:**
   - Planet name is the primary identifier (used for lookups)
   - Planet ID is assigned by GameState but secondary to name
   - Both are required and assigned together at planet creation

7. **Sentinel Values:**
   - `UNKNOWN_DOUBLE_VALUE = -500.0` for unknown double fields
   - `UNKNOWN_INT_VALUE = -500` for unknown int32_t fields
   - `INCOME_UNKNOWN = INT32_MIN` for unknown income
   - `NOT_OWNED = 0` for unowned planets
   - `OWNER_UNKNOWN = UINT32_MAX` for unknown owner
   - Player IDs must never be 0 (reserved for NOT_OWNED)

8. **PlanetSnapshot:**
   - Represents a player's knowledge of a planet at a specific observation time
   - Two factory methods: `partial_info()` and `full_info()`
   - Tracks which player created the snapshot (`as_seen_by`)
   - Stores apparent values (temperature, gravity) based on observer's ideals

- ✅ Fleet movement tracking (distance_to_destination, turns_to_destination)
- ✅ Fleet fuel management (refuel() and partial_refuel() methods)
- ✅ ShipDesign tech levels made private with public getters
- ✅ ShipDesign constructor for initialization during creation
- ✅ Friend function set_ship_design_tech() for controlled initialization
- ✅ Player class updated with fleets vector and next_fleet_id counter
- ✅ GameState fleet management methods (create_fleet, get_fleet, delete_fleet, etc.)
- ✅ Ship class completely eliminated
- ✅ Removed galaxy.ships vector
- ✅ Removed player_ships mapping from GameState
- ✅ Created ship_design.h for dedicated ShipDesign header

**Objective:** Improve GameState architecture for better separation of concerns; implement text asset management system

**Completed:**
- ✅ Moved `current_turn` from Galaxy to GameState (better ownership semantics)
- ✅ Added `current_year` tracking to GameState (independent from turn numbering)
- ✅ Refactored fleet ID allocation: moved from Player to GameState for global uniqueness
- ✅ Fleet constructor made private with Player as friend class (controlled construction)
- ✅ Fleet::fuel changed from double to int32_t for consistency with tech levels
- ✅ Added reverse enum lookup for ShipType using std::map
- ✅ Created GameSetup orchestration layer for game initialization
- ✅ GameState constructor now takes GameSetup reference for one-step initialization
- ✅ GameState copies setup data (galaxy_params, player_setups) as members
- ✅ Added `start_first_turn()` method for initial turn state setup
- ✅ Implemented RNG state serialization for multiplayer host migration
- ✅ Added ColonyQuality enum with reverse lookup (7 quality levels: Outpost→Abundant)
- ✅ Added starting_colony_quality to PlayerSetup (hardcoded to NORMAL)
- ✅ Created TextAssets system with JSON-based text management
- ✅ Implemented TextAssets class with loaders for 5 JSON files
- ✅ Tech level names now use explicit std::map<uint32_t, std::string> (handles non-sequential levels)
- ✅ Added Gender enum (GENDER_F=1, GENDER_M=2)
- ✅ Added accessor methods: get_planet_name_list(), get_player_name_list(Gender)
- ✅ Created TextAssets directory with 5 JSON files (planets, players, ships, techs, radical)
- ✅ Cleaned up text asset parsing (removed artifacts, split merged entries)

**Architecture Improvements:**
- GameSetup handles user interaction and parameter collection

- ✅ GalaxyGenerationParams struct with n_planets, density, shape, seed
- ✅ GalaxyShape enum (RANDOM, SPIRAL, CIRCLE, RING, CLUSTER, GRID)
- ✅ Galaxy constructor with deferred initialization
- ✅ Galaxy::initialize_planets() fully implemented for RANDOM shape
- ✅ Ownership refactored: Players owned by GameState, not Galaxy
- ✅ Immutable entity mappings (planet_id_to_index, player_id_to_index, etc.)
- ✅ Mutable entity mappings (player_fleets, player_planets)
- ✅ GameSetup orchestration layer ready
- ✅ GameState initialization complete and tested
- ✅ Text assets system ready for use

**Remaining (Next Session):**
- [ ] Implement spiral galaxy distribution algorithm
- [ ] Implement circle galaxy distribution algorithm (candidate for Poisson disk sampling)
- [ ] Implement ring galaxy distribution algorithm
- [ ] Implement cluster galaxy distribution algorithm
- [ ] Distribute planets to players (starting positions)
- [ ] Initialize player resources (money, metal, technology)
- [ ] Distribute starting fleets to players
- [ ] Initialize planetKnowledge vectors for fog of war
- [ ] Set up initial planet observations

**Future Enhancement (Phase 2c-Extended):**
- [ ] Implement Poisson disk sampling (Bridson's algorithm) for circle/ring/cluster shapes
- [ ] See Documentation/PoissonDiskSamplingOverview.md for algorithm details
- [ ] Benefits: O(N) performance, no placement failures, uniform distribution
- [ ] Will replace current naive random placement for these shapes
**This document is the single source of truth for the OpenHo project. It should be updated after each significant session to reflect progress and maintain accuracy for future sessions.**
#### Phase 2c: Galaxy Initialization (CRITICAL)
**Status:** ✅ SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE (Session: Jan 1, 2026)
**Objective:** Generate and populate galaxy with planets; assign starting planets and resources to players

**Completed (This Session):**
- ✅ Randomized planet name generation using utility function
- ✅ CheckDistanceSpatialGrid class for O(N) collision detection
- ✅ Minimum 4.0 unit distance enforcement between planets
- ✅ Shape-specific initialization methods (random fully implemented, others templated)
- ✅ Grid galaxy shape with deterministic spacing
- ✅ Debug logging for planet placement failures
- ✅ Planet_Placement_Max_Attempts and Planet_Placement_Debug_Threshold constants
- ✅ Error handling for planets that cannot be placed
